## About ##

Snakemake library for all kinds of tasks, with a focus on
bioinformatics and next-generation sequencing. See
[the wiki](https://github.com/percyfal/snakemakelib/wiki) for more
information.

## Quickstart ##

Probably the best way to get started is to run a real example. See the
[repaper](<https://github.com/percyfal/repaper>) repository for
workflows that should work out of the box.
