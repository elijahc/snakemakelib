Workflows
=========

scRNAseq
---------

Single-cell RNA sequencing workflow. This workflow is based on a setup
by Åsa Björklund. See
`repaper/Treutlein\_2014 <https://github.com/percyfal/repaper/tree/master/Treutlein_2014>`__
for an example. The rulegraph is shown below.

ATAC-seq
----------

Implementation of workflow in Buenrostro et al 2013 for ATAC-seq. See
`repaper/Buenrostro\_2013 <https://github.com/percyfal/repaper/tree/master/Buenrostro_2013>`__
for an example. The rulegraph is shown below.
